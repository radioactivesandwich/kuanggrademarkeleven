    <h2 class="recipeTitle">Sheet Pan Eggplant Parmesan</h2>
    <img class="recipeImg" src="images/eggplant.jpg">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium eggplant, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 Tbsps olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (25 ounce) jar tomato sauce</li>
      <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>julienned fresh basil, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Spread the sliced eggplant in a single layer onto paper towels. Generously salt the eggplant and let it sit for 15 minutes. Flip the eggplant, salt the other side, and let sit for another 15 minutes.  Rince the eggplant with water and pat dry with clean paper towels. (This process will draw out the excess moisture and bitterness from the eggplant.  I have seen some skip this step entirely.)</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the panko breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, dried basil, dried oregano, and garlic powder in a shallow dish.  In a separate dish, lightly beat the eggs with the water.</li>
      <li>Dip the eggplant slices in the egg and then the breadcrumb mixture, pressing the breadcumbs onto the eggplant to evenly coat both sides.</li>
      <li>Drizzle a foil-lined sheet pan with the olive oil and spread it around to cover the whole pan.  Place the breaded eggplant in a single layer on the baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, flip the slices, then bake for an additional 10 minutes on the other side. Spoon sauce onto each slice and top with shredded cheese.  Return to the oven and continue baking for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.  Top with fresh basil right before serving.</li>

    <h2 class="recipeTitle">Traditional Indian Samosas</h2>
    <img class="recipeImg" src="images/samosas.jpg">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup dry USA green or yellow split peas, rinsed</li>
      <li>2.5 cups water</li>
      <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
      <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons minced fresh ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander (with a few whole coriander seeds sprinkled in)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 to 2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>Chutney or tomato ketchup, for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (whole wheat flour preferred)</li>
      <li>1⁄2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1⁄2 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1⁄4 cup canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, combine split peas and water. Bring them to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until peas are tender, about 35 to 45 minutes. Drain peas, and set aside.</li>
      <li>Boil potatoes with 1 teaspoon salt until they are tender. Drain, and mash the potatoes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare the dough. Combine flour and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Make a well in the center and add yogurt and canola oil. Mix ingredients until they form a ball.</li>
      <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it until it is smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes. Cover dough, and set it aside for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a heavy skillet. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until they are translucent. Add ginger, and continue stirring for another minute. Add coriander, garam masala, and salt, and cook, stirring, for about a half minute more. Add potatoes and peas, and mix well. Set filling aside.</li>
      <li>On lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle measuring about 12 x 18 inches. Cut dough into 3-inch squares.</li>
      <li>Place 1 scant tablespoon of filling on each square. Use your fingers to moisten edges of dough with water, and fold dough diagonally in half to make a triangle. Press edges firmly together to seal in the filling.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 inch oil in a heavy skillet until it is hot but not smoking, about 350° to 380°. Fry samosas until golden, turning once. Drain samosas on paper towels, and keep them hot.</li>
      <li>Transfer samosas to a heated serving dish, and serve them with chutney or tomato ketchup.</li>
